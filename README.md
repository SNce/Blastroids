Blastroids
==========

A simple remake of the original asteroids game with a load of experiments on 2D game engines!

The aim is to build a multi-platform 2D engine. Efforts will be focused towards keeping the gameplay,
engine and renderer as loosely coupled from the platform as possible. (ideally completely abstracted away).

The approach will be to get most components of the engine working first and optmize later.

Remember... "Premature optimization is the root of all evil".

NOTE: You will see a bunch of dirty hacks since I am racing to finish this game for a submission.
I will surely come back and fix them!
